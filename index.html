                <h4>SpaceX</h4>
                <p>Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[78] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[79] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[79] With $100 million of his own money,[80] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.</p>

            <h4>Tesla</h4>
            <p >Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[112] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[113] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.</p>

            <h4>Starlink</h4>
            <p>In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[97] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[98] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[99][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.</p>

            <h4>Neuralink</h4>
            <p>n 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[170] He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research,[174] although Musk's being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.[175] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[176][177][178] with MIT Technology Review describing them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".[176] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[173] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year</p>
